# QA-System_Advanced-RAG_10K-Filing-Analysis
A robust RAG pipeline built using LlamaIndex for intelligent question-answering over financial documents. This project demonstrates how to extract meaningful insights from over a decade of Coca-Cola’s 10-K filings using advanced retrievers, rerankers, and sub-question engines—while optimizing for performance, cost, and transparency.

Multi-Retriever Evaluation: Implements and compares Sentence Window, Auto-Merging, and Auto Retriever strategies.
Advanced RAG Pipeline: Combines the best retriever with reranker and sub-question decomposition.
Faithfulness & Relevancy Scoring: Evaluates synthesized answers with human-aligned QA metrics.
Caching for Cost Optimization: Reduces redundant API calls for efficient usage.
Source Traceability: Each generated answer is backed by inspectable source content.

🚀 Tech Stack:
LlamaIndex
OpenAI GPT
ChromaDB
LangChain (optional modules)
Python

📊 Ideal For:
Researchers, data scientists, and financial analysts exploring GenAI for document understanding, compliance automation, and insights generation.
